The Analog Clock Project
Telling time is a task no-one thinks much of. People learn it at a fairly early age, and then it
becomes a second nature to us. You look at your clock dial, and within less than a second your
brain processes the image and translates a circle with three hands into meaningful data. But
have you ever thought about how it happens?


Think back to before you learned how the clock worked: It must have looked like gibberish
to you. How did you learn how to read an analog clock? You must have been instructed to
follow these simple steps:
                         1. Look for the shortest hand, check after what number it is. This is the hour.
                         2. Look for the longer thicker hand. Multiply the number it points to by five. That’s the
                             current number of minutes.
                         3. Look for the longest, thin hand. Multiply the number it points to by five. That’s the
                             current number of seconds.

My main goal for this project was to develop a model for analog clock identification, and to
implement it with a program that would be able to receive an image of a clock, and return
the time displayed after its analysis. I strived to write a program that would reach an
acceptable success rate, and would work on a broad range of images.
